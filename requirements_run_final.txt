REQUIREMENTS AND HOW TO RUN

Hi, this is just a small note on how to run the project and what things you need. I’ve tried to keep it simple :)

---

1. WHAT YOU NEED INSTALLED

You’ll need a few Python packages to make the code run properly. These are the ones I used:

  - transformers
  - datasets
  - evaluate
  - torch
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

To install all of them in one go, just run this:

pip install transformers datasets evaluate torch pandas numpy scikit-learn

I ran everything in Jupyter Notebook, but you can also use VS Code or Colab if you want.

2. WHAT FILES ARE IN THIS PROJECT

Here’s what you’ll see in the main folder:

  * clinical_summary_generator.ipynb  (this is the main notebook I used)
  * dataset/  (this folder has all the CSV files from the MTS Dialog dataset)
  * screenshots/  (has the sample output and ROUGE score pics)
  * README.md  (short overview of the project)
  * requirements_run.txt  (this file)

3. HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

Once you’ve downloaded everything and you’re inside the folder:

  1. Open the notebook like this:

     jupyter notebook clinical_summary_generator.ipynb

  2. Run each cell one by one. First the data loads, then the model, then it trains and finally shows some example summaries and ROUGE scores.

That’s it really.

NOTE:

The data is already in CSV format and doesn’t need to be merged or cleaned or anything. It’s ready to use. The model is FLAN-T5-small so it should work fine on most machines.

Hope this helps :)
